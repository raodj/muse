Test bed for LSTM polling policy

These scripts have been slightly modified from original testing scripts.

Generally, execute 'submit_my_jobs.sh' first.
After all jobs have completed, execute 'run_gen_stats.sh'

NOTE: The selected paramters in 'submit_my_jobs.sh' and 'run_gen_stats.sh'
      need to be identical.
TODO: This should be condensed so that the seleceted parameters are
	  set in a single location.
