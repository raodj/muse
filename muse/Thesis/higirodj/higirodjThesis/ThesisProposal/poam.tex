\section{Plan of Action and Milestones}

This section describes the work that needs to be conducted to complete the research thesis.
\begin{itemize}

\item[\ding{182}] \textbf{ Implement 2 additional simulation models}: The experimental analysis was conducted using PHOLD. We will extend the experimental analysis to include 2 additional models in order to evaluate performance of the data structures across different simulation models. The 2 simulation models will be implemented by 30 March 2017.

\item[\ding{183}] \textbf{Assessment using additional simulation models}: The assessment of data structure performance using the models in sequential and optimistic parallel simulations will be completed by 28 April 2017.

\item[\ding{184}] \textbf{Record experimental results and analysis}: The research thesis writing will be completed by 19 May 2017 in preparation for the thesis defense.

\end{itemize}
