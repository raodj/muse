\begin{flushleft}
Thank you to my adviser Dr. Rao M. Dhananjai for his encouragement and support during the completion of this thesis and throughout my time at Miami University.  Without his guidance, I certainly would not be where I am now.  Additionally, I would like to acknowledge my committee members Dr. Matthew Stephan, and Dr. Janhui Yue for their support and input.
