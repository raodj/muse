This wizard guides you through the process of creating a job. A job runs on a selected server (in parallel if so configured) and computes “MUSE” data (replace this with a better description later…). The executable for this project is chosen from a Project that has been previously added to the workspace.<br/><br/>

The time take to compute “MUSE” data is X, and a more detailed explanation will follow eventually. It is best to run sets in parallel to obtain the results more quickly.
