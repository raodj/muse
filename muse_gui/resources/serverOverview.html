  This wizard guides you through the process of installing   the PEACE computational backend software system on the   local computer (aka server) or a remote server. Currently,   only Linux servers are supported for remote machines.<br><br>   For accessing remote computational clusters, this wizard will   prompt you to enter your credentials (user name and password).   The user name is persisted in the workspace configuration but   <i>the password is not persisted for security reasons</i>. Therefore,   you will be prompted to enter password(s) once each time PEACE   is run.<br><br>   <b>Note</b>: The process of installing PEACE backend on a Linux   server takes 3-5 minutes depending on your network,   speed of remote server, and load on the machine.
