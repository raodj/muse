This data was collected to explore the impact of two parameters:

1. varying the receiver using a uniform distribution.
2. Changing recv time values from exponential to uniform

These tests essentially use the following command-line arguments:

--recvr-range 10000 --recvr-distrib uniform --delay-distrib uniform
