abstract = "Bloom-forming and toxin-producing cyanobacteria remain
	        a persistent nuisance across the world. Modelling of
            cyanobacteria in freshwaters is an important tool
            for understanding their population dynamics and
            predicting the location and timing of the bloom
            events in lakes and rivers. A new
            deterministic-mathematical model was developed,
            which simulates the growth and movement of
            cyanobacterial blooms in river systems. The model
            focuses on the mathematical description of the bloom
            formation, vertical migration and lateral transport
            of colonies within river environments by taking into
            account the major factors that affect the
            cyanobacterial bloom formation in rivers including,
            light, nutrients and temperature. A technique called
            generalised sensitivity analysis was applied to the
            model to identify the critical parameter
            uncertainties in the model and investigates the
            interaction between the chosen parameters of the
            model. The result of the analysis suggested that 8
            out of 12 parameters were significant in obtaining
            the observed cyanobacterial behaviour in a
            simulation. It was found that there was a high
            degree of correlation between the half-saturation
            rate constants used in the model. "
