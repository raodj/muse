  The choice of data structure for managing and processing pending
  events in timestamp priority order plays a critical role in
  achieving good performance of sequential and parallel Discrete Event
  Simulation (DES).  Accordingly, we propose and evaluate the
  effectiveness of multi-tiered (2 and 3 tier) data structures,
  including our proposed 2-tier Ladder Queue, for both sequential and
  optimistic parallel simulations, on distributed memory platforms.
  Our assessments use (a fine-tuned version of) the Ladder Queue,
  which has shown to outperform many other data structures for DES.
  The experimental results based on the PHOLD benchmark and the PCS simulation model show that our
  3-tier heap and 2-tier ladder queue outperform the Ladder Queue by
  10\% to 50\% in simulations, particularly those with higher
  concurrency per Logical Process (LP), in both sequential and Time
  Warp synchronized parallel simulations.
